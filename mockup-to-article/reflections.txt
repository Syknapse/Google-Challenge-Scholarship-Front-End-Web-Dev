You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
        I have found both the tree model explanations and the excercise of going from mockup to html to be most useful

  * What has been easy?
        As I have already done html and css, this all has been easy so far

  * What has been difficult?
        Nothing. 

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
        It has been pretty straight forward.
